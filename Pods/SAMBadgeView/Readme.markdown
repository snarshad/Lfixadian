# SAMBadgeView

A simple badge view that acts very much like the badges in Mail.app, with the key difference being that Apple uses images and SAMBadgeView is rendered with Core Graphics for improved scrolling performance (although images are supported). This also allows for more flexible resizing.

SAMBadgeView is tested on iOS 6 and requires ARC. Released under the [MIT license](LICENSE).

Open up the included Xcode project for an example app and the tests.

## Installation

Simply add the files in the `SAMBadgeView.h` and `SAMBadgeView.m` to your project or add `SAMBadgeView` to your Podfile if you're using CocoaPods.
